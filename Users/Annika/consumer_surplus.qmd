## Setup

Only mandatory

## Consumer Surplus

The change in consumer surplus resulting from scenario A relative to baseline is:

$$
{1/\alpha}\sum_{leverA} INEXUS_{it} - {1/\alpha}\sum_{baseline} INEXUS_{it} 
$$

Here we are assuming that ${\alpha = .1}$, so multiply the INEXUS by 10 to get the
INEXUS scaled into a dollar amount

## calculate change in CS for 3 levers relative to baseline, with a table

```{r}


```

## CS heterogeneity

Choose one of the scenarios that gives the biggest difference, and then calculate
for income quartiles

```{r}

```
