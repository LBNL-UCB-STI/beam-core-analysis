## Consumer Surplus

The change in consumer surplus resulting from scenario A relative to baseline is:

$$
{1/\alpha}\sum_{scenarioA} INEXUS_{it} - {1/\alpha}\sum_{scenario} INEXUS_{it} 
$$

Here we are assuming that ${\alpha = }$

## CS for scenarios relative to baseline

```{r}


```

## CS heterogeneity

Choose one of the scenarios that gives the biggest difference, and then calculate
for low income, etc

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
