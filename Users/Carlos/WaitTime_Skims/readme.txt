This folder contains the following Jupyter notebooks:
1. ProcessingSkims-Step1: downloads all skims by scenario run and creates a master RH solo and RH pooled skim wait times file per time period.
2. ProcessingSkims-Step2: produces plots of median wait times, by changes in number of fleets, fleet size, RH solo/pool prices.
3. PersonTrip_Skims_Join: current (unfinished) code joining together skim wait times to person-trip dataset. Code works for baseline but generalising it to do the same across scenarios results in memory issues.
